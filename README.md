# python-web-crawler-improved
This python crawler is created during the Christmas Recess. Totally for fun!
I will keep updating the project with new features and making it more robust.

I heavily used Regex instead of using more general modules to handle URL.

The whole project has four main function right now: downloading the source code of webpage, downloading files specified by file extensions, downloading CSS and images in it, and comment on Javascripts.
